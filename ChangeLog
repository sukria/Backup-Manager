	* lib/upload-methods.sh:
	  + Added support for the ServerAliveInterval ssh option. It is
	  unconditional for now, but we should check if all supported version
	  of ssh support it. This helps when the "building file list" step of
	  rsync takes a loooong time (high I/O load for example), and the
	  connection is closed because of non-activity. It is currently
	  hardcoded to 60s, which seems like a good compromise.
