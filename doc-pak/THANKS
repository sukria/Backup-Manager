I would like to thank Esteban Manchado Velázquez who has helped me a lot in 
the debianization of backup-manager. All his advices and comments made me 
aware of some interesting issues and gave backup-manager a better shape.

Also a big thank to everyone who helped the backup-manager project, 
translators, contributors and of course, users.

  - Alexis Sukrieh.
