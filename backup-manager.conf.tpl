# $BM_ARCHIVE_PREFIX-$BM_PIPE_NAME.$DATE.$BM_PIPE_FILETYPE
# If you specified a BM_PIPE_COMPRESS option, the resulting filename 
# will change as expected (eg, .gz if "gzip").

# Archive a remote MySQL database through SSH:

#    BM_PIPE_NAME[0]="base" 
#    BM_PIPE_FILETYPE[0]="sql"

# Archive a specific directory, on a remote server through SSH:
#    BM_PIPE_COMMAND[0]="ssh host -c \"tar -c -z /home/user\"" 
#    BM_PIPE_NAME[0]="host.home.user"
