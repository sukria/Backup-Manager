<chapt id="about">About this manual

<sect id="about-scope">Scope
<p>
&bmngr; is a system tool designed to hanlde backups. It is written with
simplicity in mind. 

<p>
If you want to handle a couple of tarballs, reading the
default configuration file might be enough to understand the main design.
On the other hand, if you want to know more about the global design of the
program, how to write your own backup methods or even look at some real life
examples, this guide is for you.

<p>
This document describes the main design of the software and gives informations
about supported configuration keys. Every backup methods are described, with
a sample configuration file as illustration. Whenever possible, advices and best
practices are given. 

<p>
This manual also describes every configuration variables supported in the
version &bmngr-version;, these are available in appendices for a quick reference.

<sect id="about-version">Version

<p>
This is the first version of this document, it was first released with 
the release 0.6 of &bmngr;.


<sect id="about-authors">Authors
<p>
The first version of this document was made in late 2005, by Alexis Sukrieh.

<p>
While the author of this document has tried hard to avoid typos and other 
errors, these do still occur. If you discover an error in this manual or if
you want to give any comments, suggestions, or criticisms please send an 
email to the development list, backup-manager-devel@backup-manager.org, or submit
a bug report against the "Documentation" product, in the bug tracking system.

<chapt id="design">Repository and Archives

<p>
&bmngr; stores <em>archives</em> it builds in a <em>repository</em>.
<em>Archives</em> are built by using a <em>backup method</em>. 

<sect id="archive-repo">The Repository

<!-- -->
<sect1 id="BM_REPOSITORY_ROOT"><tt>BM_REPOSITORY_ROOT</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: string, default: <tt>/var/archives</tt>.</em>

<p>
The repository is the place in your filesystem
where every archives are stored.
This is a particular place for &bmngr;, it will be cleaned during backup
sessions: archives older than the authorized lifetime will be purged.
If the repository does not exist, it will be created at runtime.

<p>
Isolating the repository on a dedicated partition is a good idea. This can
prevent the repository from eating all the disk space of the partition.
With a bad configuration file, backup sessions can lead to huge archives, 
for many reasons, so take care).

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_REPOSITORY_ROOT="/var/archives"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_REPOSITORY_SECURE"><tt>BM_REPOSITORY_SECURE</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: boolean, default: <tt>true</tt>.</em>

<p>
For security reasons, the repository can be accessible by a specific user/group
pair. This will prevent the archives from being readable (and writable) by any user
in the system. This mode is enabled by default (owned by <tt>root:root</tt>).

<p>
To enable this mode, set the configuration key <tt>BM_REPOSITORY_SECURE</tt> 
to <tt>yes</tt>, then update <tt>BM_REPOSITORY_USER</tt> and
<tt>BM_REPOSITORY_GROUP</tt> to your needs.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_REPOSITORY_SECURE="true"
export BM_REPOSITORY_USER="root"
export BM_REPOSITORY_GROUP="root"
</example>

<sect id="archives">Archives

<p>
<em>Archives are produced by backup methods, they can be virtually anything, but
will always be named like the following: <tt>prefix-name-date.filetype</tt>.
An archive is a file that contains data, it can be compressed or not, in a binary
form or not.</em>

<sect1 id="BM_ARCHIVE_PURGEDUPS"><tt>BM_ARCHIVE_PURGEDUPS</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: boolean, default: <tt>true</tt>.</em>

<p>
If disk usage matters in your backup strategy, you might find useful to use
&bmngr;'s duplicates purging feature. When an archive is generated, &bmngr;
looks at the previous versions of this archive. 
If it finds that a previous archive is the same file as the one it
has just built, the previous one is replaced by a symlink to the new one.
This is useful if you don't want to have twice the same archive in the
repository.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_ARCHIVE_PURGEDUPS="true"

# ls -l /var/archives
wrw-rw---- 1 root root  138 2005-11-15 10:46 host-etc.20051115.tar.gz
wrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   51 2005-11-17 10:31 host-etc.20051116.tar.gz -> /var/archives/host-etc.20051117.tar.gz
-rw-rw---- 1 root root  137 2005-11-17 10:31 host-etc.20051117.tar.gz
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_ARCHIVE_TTL"><tt>BM_ARCHIVE_TTL</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: integer, default: <tt>5</tt>.</em>

<p>
One of the main concept behind the handling of the repository is to purge
deprecated archives automatically. The purge session is always performed
when you launch &bmngr;. During this phase, every archives older than the
authorized lifetime are droped.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_ARCHIVE_TTL="5"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_ARCHIVE_PREFIX"><tt>BM_ARCHIVE_PREFIX</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: string, default: <tt>$HOSTNAME</tt>.</em>

<p>
This is the prefix used for naming archives.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_ARCHIVE_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME"

# echo $HOSTNAME
ouranos
# ls /var/archives
ouranos-20051123.md5 
ouranos-usr-local-src.20051123.tar.gz
ouranos-etc.20051123.tar.gz
</example>

<chapt id="methods">Backup Methods

<p>
The core feature of &bmngr; is to make archives, for doing this, a
<em>method</em> is used. Each method can require a set of configuration keys.
We will describe here every method supported in the version &version;.

<p>
The method you choose must be defined in the configuration key
<tt>BM_ARCHIVE_METHOD</tt>. You can put here a list of all the different methods 
you want to use. Take care to put every configuration keys needed by all the 
methods you choose.
Note that you can also choose none of the propsoed methods, if you don't want
to build archives with this configuration file, then just put <tt>none</tt>.

<p>
A couple of other configuration keys may be needed depending on the method you
choose. 

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_ARCHIVE_METHOD="tarball-incremental mysql"
</example>

<sect id="tarball">Tarballs

<sect1 id="tarball-desc">Description

<p>
<em>Method name: <tt>tarball</tt>, configuration key prefix: <tt>BM_TARBALL</tt>.</em>

<p>
If all you want to do is to handle a couple of tarballs of your file system, you
can use this method.  This method takes a list of directories
and builds the corresponding tarballs.  
This method is the default one, this is the easiest to use, it just
builds tarballs as you could do with your own tar script. Its main drawback is
to eat a lot of disk space: archives can be big from a day to another, even if
there is no changes in their content. See the <tt>tarball-incremental</tt>
method if you want to optimize archives' size.

<p>
A couple of options are available: the name format
of the archive, the compression type (gzip, zip, bzip2, none) and the
facility to dereference symlinks when building the tarball.

<sect1 id="BM_TARBALL_NAMEFORMAT"><tt>BM_TARBALL_NAMEFORMAT</tt>
<p>
This configuration key defines how to perform the naming of the archive. Two
values are possible:

<list>
<item><tt>long</tt>: the name will be made with the absolute path of the directory
(eg: <tt>var-log-apache</tt> for <tt>/var/log/apache</tt>).
<item><tt>short</tt>: the name will just contains the directory (eg:
<tt>apache</tt> for <tt>/var/log/apache</tt>). 
</list>

<p>
Suggested value: <tt>long</tt>.

<sect1 id="BM_TARBALL_FILETYPE"><tt>BM_TARBALL_FILETYPE</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: enum(tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, zip), default: <tt>tar.gz</tt>.</em>

<p>
Basically, this configuration key defines the filetype of the resulting archive.
In a way, it defines which compressor to use (zip, gzip or bzip2).
Here are the supported values: <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>tar.gz</tt>, <tt>tar.bz2</tt>,
<tt>zip</tt>. Note that depending on the filetype you choose, you will have to
make sure you have the corresponding compressor.

<p>
For the best compression rate, choose <tt>tar.bz2</tt>.

<sect1 id="BM_TARBALL_DUMPSYMLINKS"><tt>BM_TARBALL_DUMPSYMLINKS</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: boolean, default: <tt>true</tt>.</em>

<p>
It is possible, when generating the tarball (or the zip file) to dereference the
symlinks. If you enable this feature, every symbolic links in the file system
will be replaced in the archive by the file the point to. Use this feature with
care, it can quickly leads to huge archive, or even worse: if you have a
circular symlink somewhere, this will lead to an infinite archive!

<p>
In most of the cases, you should not use this feature.

<sect1 id="BM_TARBALL_DIRECTORIES"><tt>BM_TARBALL_DIRECTORIES</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: space-separated list, default: <tt>""</tt>.</em>

<p>
You certainly want to backup something, don't you? So here is the place where
you put that precious list of locations. 

<p>
Example: 

<example>
export BM_TARBALL_DIRECTORIES="/etc /home /var/log/apache"
</example>

<sect id="tarballinc">Incremental tarballs
<sect1 id="tarballinc-desc">Description

<p>
<em>Method name: <tt>tarball-incremental</tt>, configuration keys prefix:
<tt>BM_TARBALLINC</tt>.</em>

<p>
If you want to handle tarballs without wasting disk space, you should use this
method. The concept of this method is simple: You choose a frequency when a full
backup is made (exactly like the one made by the tarball mehod). All the days
between two full backups, archives contain only the files that have changed from
the previous archive.

<p>
For instance, let's say you want to backup /home with this method. Your /home
directory is composed by two sub-directories: /home/foo and /home/bar.
You choose a weekly frequency and say that monday will be the "fullbackup" day.
Obviously, you will have a full tarball of /home on monday. 
Then, if a file changed inside /home/foo and if /home/bar
remains unchanged, tuesday's archive will only contains the modified files of
/home/foo. Using this method will save a lot of disk space.

<p>
This method uses all the tarball's configuration keys and adds two more. One to
define the kind of frequency, the other to choose on which day should the full
backups be made. 

<sect1 id="BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATETYPE"><tt>BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATETYPE</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: enum(weekly, monthly), default: <tt>weekly</tt>.</em>

<p>
This is the type of frequency you want to use. If you choose <tt>weekly</tt>,
you'll have to choose a day number between 1 and 7 for the
BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATEVALUE configuration key, if you choose <tt>monthly</tt>,
the day number will be between 1 and 31.


<sect1 id="BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATEVALUE"><tt>BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATEVALUE</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: integer, default: <tt>1</tt>.</em>

<p>
The number of the day when making full backups. Note that its meaning directly
depends on the <tt>BM_TARBALLINC_MASTERDATETYPE</tt>. 
For instance, 1 means <em>"monday"</em> if you
choose a weekly frequency, but it means <em>"the first day of the month"</em>
if you choose a monthly frequency.

<sect id="mysql">MySQL databases
<sect1 id="mysql-desc">Description

<p>
<em>Method name: <tt>mysql</tt>, configuration keys prefix:
<tt>BM_MYSQL</tt>.</em>

<p>
This method provides a way to archive MySQL databases, the archives are made with 
mysqldump (SQL text files) and can be compressed.

<sect1 id="BM_MYSQL_DATABASES"><tt>BM_MYSQL_DATABASES</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: space-separated list, default: <tt>mysql</tt>.</em>
<p>
This is the list of databases you want to archive.
<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_MYSQL_DATABASES="mysql mybase wordpress dotclear phpbb2"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_MYSQL_ADMINLOGIN"><tt>BM_MYSQL_ADMINLOGIN</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: string, default: <tt>root</tt>.</em>

<p>
The MySQL login you want to use for connecting to the database. Make sure this login 
can read all the databases you've set in <tt>BM_MYSQL_DATABASES</tt>.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_MYSQL_ADMINLOGIN="root"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_MYSQL_HOST"><tt>BM_MYSQL_HOST</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: string, default: <tt>localhost</tt>.</em>

<p>
The database host where are the databases.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_MYSQL_HOST="localhost"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_MYSQL_PORT"><tt>BM_MYSQL_PORT</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: string, default: <tt>3306</tt>.</em>

<p>
The port on <tt>BM_MYSQL_HOST</tt> where the mysql server is listening.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_MYSQL_PORT="3306"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_MYSQL_FILETYPE"><tt>BM_MYSQL_FILETYPE</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: enum(gzip, bzip2), default: <tt>bzip2</tt>.</em>

<p>
The archive is made with mysqldump which renders SQL lines; the 
resulting text file can be compressed.
If you want to compress the file, choose the compressor you want.
Leave it blank if you want pure SQL files.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_MYSQL_FILETYPE="bzip2"
</example>

<sect id="svn">Subversion repositories
<sect1 id="svn-desc">Description

<p>
You can archive Subversion repositories with this method. The archive will be 
made with <tt>svnadmin</tt> and will contain XML data (text files).
Like the mysql method, you can choose to compress it.

<sect1 id="BM_SVN_REPOSITORIES"><tt>BM_SVN_REPOSITORIES</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: space-separated list</em>

<p>
This is the list of absolute paths to the SVN repositories to archive.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_SVN_REPOSITORIES="/srv/svnroot/repo1 /srv/svnroot/repo2"
</example>

<sect1 id="BM_SVN_COMPRESSWITH"><tt>BM_SVN_COMPRESSWITH</tt>

<p>
<em>Type: enum(gzip, bzip2), default: <tt>bzip2</tt>.</em>

<p>
If you want to compress the resulting XML files, choose a compressor here.
Leave this blank if you don't want any compression.

<p>
Example:

<example>
export BM_SVN_COMPRESSWITH="gzip"
</example>

<sect id="pipe">Generic methods
<sect1 id="pipe-desc">Description

<p>
Even if most of the common needs are covered by the existing methods, there is always
a case uncovered. &bmngr; provide a way for backing up anything, and can be used in such 
circumstances.

<p>
This method is called <tt>pipe</tt>, it is more complex to use but can virtually backup anything.
The concept is simple, a pipe method is defined by the following items:

<list>
<item>A name (for naming the archive)
<item>A command (that produces content on stdout)
<item>A file type (txt, sql, dump, ...)
<item>A compressor (gzip, bzip2)
</list>

<p>
Those configuration keys are arrays, so you can implement as many pipe methods
as you like.

<p>
For each pipe method defined, &bmngr; will launch the command given and redirect 
the content sent to stdout by this command to a file named with the name of the 
method and its filetype. Then, if the method uses a compressor, the file will 
be compressed.

<sect1 id="pipe-example">Example
<p>
Example for archiving a remote MySQL database through SSH:

<example>
BM_PIPE_COMMAND[0]="ssh host -c \"mysqldump -ufoo -pbar base\"" 
BM_PIPE_NAME[0]="base" 
BM_PIPE_FILETYPE[0]="sql"
BM_PIPE_COMPRESS[0]="gzip"
</example>

<p>
Imagine you have a second pipe method to implement, for instance building 
a tarball trough SSH:

<example>
BM_PIPE_COMMAND[1]="ssh host -c \"tar -c -z /home/user\"" 
BM_PIPE_NAME[1]="host.home.user" 
BM_PIPE_FILETYPE[1]="tar.gz"
BM_PIPE_COMPRESS[1]=""
</example>

<p>
Note that we have incremented the array's index.
