Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Backup Manager is a command line backup tool for GNU/Linux, designed 
to help you make daily archives of your file system.

Written in bash and perl, it can make archives in many formats
and can be run in a parallel mode with different configuration files.

Archives are kept for a given number of days and the upload system can
use ftp or scp to transfer the generated archives to a list of remote 
hosts. 
The configuration file is very simple and basic and gettext is used 
for internationalization.
