Description
-----------

Backup Manager is a command line backup tool for GNU/Linux, designed to help
you make daily archives of your file system, while being as easy to use as
possible. Written in Bash and Perl, it can generate archives in various formats
and compression schemes, and can be run in parallel with multiple configuration
files.

Archives are kept for a given number of days and can be uploaded automatically
to a list of remote hosts or burnt automatically to a CD or DVD. The
configuration file is very simple and easy to tune up according to your needs.
